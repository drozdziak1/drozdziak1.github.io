I've decided to take part in the 2017 edition of the [Daj Się
Poznać][dajsiepoznac] ("Get Noticed") competition. With this blog I hope to
learn me the secrets of Machine Learning and Data Science using Python and C++.
By writing everything down into a tutorial I want to teach **You** about all
that as well.

`Will you make this trip with me? (Y/n)`

# Edit: A change in direction
The field of Machine Learning is a vast collection of knowledge that grows
really fast. It managed to surface itself in pop culture and prove useful in
everyday tasks.

As much as I admire the field and am willing to master it, my lack of expertise
(especially in C++) might hurt the educational value of my DSP project.
