In my [previous post]({% post_url 2017-03-02-DSP17-1-the-kernel-role-in-OS %}),
I mentioned that some errors in the kernel will freeze your machine and likely
force you to reboot. You can certainly agree that whenever one learns a new
technology, mistakes are inevitable, and rebooting after every error we cause
could become a bit time-consuming. Needless to say, crashing the live kernel on
a machine with unsaved work can be **very** disheartening + there's also the
risk of messing up your filesystem.

# The plan
To speed up our development process, we're going to build ourselves a bare bones
virtual machine using an emulator called [QEMU][qemu]. This VM will then boot
the kernel and give us a simple shell with a bunch of tools. Using a virtual
machine also stands together with easy debugging and fine-grained control over
the system's virtual hardware.

Before starting this blog, I tried to build [something similar][picotux], but it
didn't turn out that great. Let's make things right this time, shall we?

# Prerequisites
Even though we're not writing any C code yet, some preparations for the
development environment are necessary. Here's what we're gonna use:
* **Linux** - Duh!
* **BusyBox** - An application suite meant as a [GNU coreutils][coreutils]
  alternative; typically built as a single size-optimized binary, which uses
  specially named symlinks to act as different command-line tools like `ls`,
  `rm`, `cp`, `tar` etc.
* **QEMU** - The hypervisor for our VM; when installing QEMU, most Linux
  distributions and [macOS][qemu-mac] should have you covered, though I don't
  recommend following this tutorial on Windows (but if you really want,
  [precompiled binaries][qemu-windows-binaries] and [Cygwin][cygwin] could be of
  help)
* **Basic grasp on GNU Make** - The classic Makefiles still remain the
  kernel's build system of choice, a little manual compilation-fu shouldn't
  hurt.
* **Working git knowledge** - Git is the industry's leading version control
  system at the moment; in fact, git's initial purpose was to track changes in
  Linux(!) after the previously used proprietary solution was discontinued. With
  both Linux and BusyBox using git, sticking to the same VCS seems like a good
  idea

# Enter the submodules!
For downloading Linux and BusyBox code, we'll use git's
[submodules][git-submodules]. Submodules are nothing more than nested
repositories checked out at a given commit in some other top-level repo. Let's
put that into perspective:

Suppose you had a git repository `foo`. Inside, you could define a submodule
`bar` pulled from a remote at `https://www.example.com/bar.git`, checked out at
`abcd1234` in a directory `bar_dir/`. When you do that, repository `foo` stores
information only about those 4 things - the submodule's name (`"bar"`), relative
path (`bar_dir/`), remote URL (`https://www.example.com/bar.git`) and the hash
of it's desired revision (`abcd1234`). That way, `foo` doesn't need to store the
whole of `bar`, while referencing a known state of its files at the same time.
When you pull the submodule, `bar_dir/` will reflect the contents of `bar` at
`abcd1234`.

# Repository setup
Let's start by creating an empty repository and pulling two submodules for Linux
and BusyBox (optionally, you could go and grab something to eat as both pulls
may take some time to complete):

```shell
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
git submodule add https://github.com/mirror/busybox.git
git commit -m "add linux and busybox submodules"
```
*Hopefully, you should end up with two directories named* `busybox` *and*
`linux`

> :information_source: Note:

> At the time of writing this post, connections to the original
> [kernel.org][linux-repo] and [busybox.net][busybox-repo] repos seem a bit
> flaky - the commands above fall back to the GitHub mirrors.

# Building Linux
Linux, being a huge project, eventually developed a build configuration system
called `kbuild`. You can expect me to explain it in a future post, but this
time we'll only nudge it a little. Let's select a default config:

```shell
cd linux/
make defconfig
```

The output should look something like this:

```plaintext
*** Default configuration is based on 'x86_64_defconfig'
#
# configuration written to .config
#
```

Now, it is time to finally compile. Let's build, already!

```shell
make -jN # N should be the number of CPU cores in your system
```

A correct build's output should end with a message about the location of your
warm, freshly built kernel - something similar to this:

```plaintext
[...]
Setup is 15836 bytes (padded to 15872 bytes).
System is 6657 kB
CRC d8c5cae9
Kernel: arch/x86/boot/bzImage is ready  (#1)
```

# Lift-off! (?)
To execute your kernel in QEMU, run this in your terminal:

```shell
qemu-system-$(uname -m) -kernel arch/$(uname -m)/boot/bzImage -append console=ttyS0 -nographic
```
*The* `$(uname -m)` *parts resolve to your architecture's name; to exit the
VM, press* `Ctrl+a` *and then* `x`

If you got QEMU correctly installed, you should see a bunch of log entries storm
through your terminal. It should then stop after a couple seconds with...

```plaintext

```

...a kernel panic.

# "Uh-oh!"
Let's peek into the log excerpt from above to figure out what it means and why
we crashed. Have a look at the first couple of lines:

```plaintext
[    4.000081] VFS: Cannot open root device "(null)" or unknown-block(0,0): error -6
[    4.003700] Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partitions:
[    4.005934] 0b00         1048575 sr0
```

In the leftmost column we can see the time since the kernel's start in a
`<seconds>.<microseconds>` format. Then, we've got a message suggesting that an
entity called `VFS` (Virtual File System, a filesystem abstraction used in
Linux) has problems with accessing some device. Looks like we forgot to define
something, as the next line follows up by requesting us to set a `root` boot
argument.

It looks like the kernel behaved exactly the way it should - we didn't name any
device to mount as `/`, so Linux just shrugs and crashes, as it doesn't even
know where to look for an `init` program.

To fix that, we're going to create a [ramdisk][ramdisk-wiki], which QEMU will
then load to act as a filesystem image for our kernel. There, we will form a
simple environment that will let us access a shell with some command-line tools.
Let's start by building BusyBox.

# Getting your box busy (Ha, ha.)
Let's head over to the BusyBox directory and create the
default configuration:

```shell
cd ../busybox
make defconfig
```
*Looks familiar, huh? BusyBox is using kbuild too!*

This time, we'll change one option in our config before starting the build. It
turns out that the default build links BusyBox **dynamically** against your host
system's shared libraries. Since our virtual machine can't provide BusyBox with
any of its dependencies, we'll need to link it **statically** - that is, to
embed the necessary libraries directly in the program's binary. To do that,
start a configuration editing script:

```shell
make menuconfig # or gconfig, xconfig
```
`menuconfig` *is one of many frontends available for editing Linux-like configs.
It's the most popular, so that's what I recommend to use.*

After the configuration window appears, select `Busybox Settings` and hit enter.
Then, use your arrows to go down and select `Build BusyBox as a static
binary (no shared libs)` (hit `space` and an asterisk should show to the left).
Exit, choose to save your changes and build!

```shell
make -jN # Again, N is your system's CPU core count
```

To make sure that the resulting executable is statically linked, let's see what
`ldd` has to say about it:

```shell
ldd ./busybox
```
`ldd` *is a tool for viewing shared library dependencies in a program*

If you got the config right, ldd should fend you off with a `not a dynamic
executable` message. Looks like we're almost there! Let's go and see about that
filesystem image.

# Creating a simple environment in an initramfs image
`initramfs` stands for `init`ial `RAM` `f`ile`s`ystem, which is basically a
small filesystem that gets loaded into RAM at boot time. It provides your kernel
with the tools it needs to proceed with bringing up the rest of your OS.

Linux sources offer many useful tools, and `usr/gen_init_cpio` is one of them.
`gen_init_cpio` is a program for generating filesystem images exactly like the
one we're after. One way to use it is to have it run during the Linux build and
append the resulting initramfs image to your kernel. Alternatively, you can keep
the image separate, and that's what we're going to do for now.

Let's start by going back to the top level of our repository. There, we'll
create a special `initramfs_desc` (pick a different name if you want) file which
will describe the files that we want in our image and where to put them. Here's
what I came up with:

```plaintext
# type          dest            src             perm    usr     grp

# dirs
dir             /bin                            775     0       0
dir             /proc                           775     0       0
dir             /sys                            775     0       0
dir             /dev/pts                        775     0       0

# files
file            /init           init.sh         775     0       0
file            /bin/busybox    busybox/busybox 775     0       0

# symlinks
slink           /bin/sh         /bin/busybox    775     0       0

# devnodes
nod             /dev/zero                       666     0       0       c 1 5
nod             /dev/null                       666     0       0       c 1 3
nod             /dev/console                    666     0       0       c 5 1
```

As you can see, each item has a type, source/destination paths (i.e. where to
find the file on your computer and where to put it in the image), permissions,
an owner user and a group (currently set to what you know as `root`). The three
entries in the low right signify special properties of character device files,
about which we'll surely talk in the future.

If you look closely, you'll also notice that in my `initramfs_desc` I listed a
`/init` file to be copied from `init.sh` shell script. You may have heard about
a thing called the `init` process - it's basically a program that runs first
thing after a UNIX-like kernel boots. This `init` program is the first userland
process and gets assigned PID 1. `init` is the parent of all processes and is
vital for a UNIX-like OS to work - in Linux, attempting to kill init results in
a kernel panic. A popular approach is to make init a service that runs programs
according to a file called [inittab][inittab-page] (a practice most widely known
from [System V][sysv-wiki]) - BusyBox provides such functionality, but for the
sake of simplicity, we're not going to get into that.

We'll create our own `init` as a simple shell script that will bootstrap
BusyBox, mount some filesystems and fire up a shell. This is what my `init.sh`
looks like:

```shell
#!/bin/sh

# BusyBox bootstrap
/bin/busybox --install -s /bin

# Mount pseudofilesystems
mount -t proc proc /proc
mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys
mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts

# Execute shell
while true; do
  /bin/sh
done
```
*Thanks to the* `/bin/busybox` :arrow_right: `/bin/sh` *symlink we've defined
earlier, BusyBox is able to provide us with a shell for executing the script.*

Let's create the image!
```shell
linux/usr/gen_init_cpio initramfs_desc > initramfs.img
```

# Lift-off! :rocket:
We are ready. Run the final QEMU command:

```shell
qemu-system-$(uname -m) -kernel linux/arch/$(uname -m)/boot/bzImage -nographic -append console=ttyS0 -initrd initramfs.img
```
Your output should look similar to mine, with a `/ #` shell prompt hidden
somewhere in the kernel logs:

Feel free to snoop around and try out the different utilities provided by
BusyBox. To see all of the available choices, just call `busybox` without
arguments.

*Me, about a year ago, when I brought up my first Linux OS*

Congratulations! :confetti_ball: Believe it or not, but what you just did in
this tutorial was bringing up a tiny Linux-based operating system. Even though
you didn't write any code, you managed to create something useful that will
later on help you safely test your stuff.

# Okay, what now?
In the next part of this course, We're going to cover kernel modules, what they
are and how to write one. There's finally gonna be actual C code involved, so
it might be a good idea to brush up on the language, if you don't know it well.

Don't hesitate to ask any questions or share your thoughts below. Constructive
criticism will always be the most appreciated.

## Known problems

# QEMU complains about permissions
QEMU commands shown above might likely fail due to insufficient permissions of
your user's account. Many distributions only allow QEMU VMs to be run by members
of the `kvm` group. Check your account with the `groups` command and if `kvm` is
not there, add it with `usermod`:

```shell
sudo usermod -a -G kvm <your_username>
```
After getting into the group, simply log out and come back in for the change to
take effect.

# `<some_package>` is not installed
It's possible that during the compilation process you'll get error messages
about missing dependencies of the build environment - this is quite normal if
you've never built any C code on your computer, just look for your
distribution's instructions on getting the necessary packages.
