Are you a touch typist? You probably are, and I am one too. Do you like moving
your hand away to reach for the mouse in order to do that one little
shit-of-a-thing that can't be dealt with using a shortcut? Of course you do...
**not!**

This time, I'd like to share some insight on ways to eradicate the wretched
rodent from your workflow and minimize the distraction involved. Because of the
scope of this series, the solutions I'm about to present are meant mainly for
the Linux user, being mostly compatible with macOS and other \*nix flavors.
Let's zoom in on the things that could help you better cherish the safety of
your home row.

# Before we abandon the mouse completely
Pointing devices **do** bring some strong arguments to the table. They assume an
undeniable position in tasks like creating digital art or CAD. Things like going
through an application for the first time can also prove your mouse worthy -
e.g. you don't have to wonder which key does what, you just find the option in a
menu and often learn the shortcut in the process.

## Stop worrying and love the shell :nerd_face: :heart: :shell:
I've gotta admit, my terminal-fu grew in my skill set to become the keystone of
my process as a programmer. I love text interfaces, for they are as concise and
expressive as it gets.

Before we advanced into graphical user interfaces, there was next to no other
option than to rely on the keyboard alone. Mice would only save you a couple
keystrokes when moving around in your editor (which, confronted with a text UI
masterpiece like vim wouldn't necessarily mean an improvement). Even today
almost every text application is easy on the mouse, if supporting it at all. For
that reason alone, it may be worth your while to give _the ancient way_ a shot,
but the benefits don't end there:

* **Consistence across distributions** - thanks to common UNIX specifications
  like [POSIX][posix], many \*nix OSes share the well known command-line
  utilities like `sed`, `grep`, `tar` or `vi`, regardless of the system in
  question being Linux, BSD, macOS or whatever
* **Almost everything you do in a terminal is scriptable** - shells,
  pipes, exit codes, stdin/stdout redirections - these make for very powerful
  building blocks for scripts that can repeat almost anything you do in a
  terminal session
* **Decent performance on potato-grade machines** - it's not much of a surprise
  that drawing elements from a finite set of predefined font characters is way
  cheaper than displaying sophisticated GUIs on the user's screen, let alone
  supporting the underlying desktop environment. Often even the dumbest of chips
  know how to speak over a serial console. Armed with the bunch of text-based
  tools, we can do great things using machines of not-so-great performance
* **Everything works over SSH** - a traditional SSH shell works way faster than
  most graphical remote desktop solutions, is really good at handling twitchy
  network connections, requires a mere fraction of the bandwidth and is a
  secure, versatile industry standard that supports all terminal programs by
  design (hence the name Secure **SHell**)
* **Where there is a shell, there is always a way** - things break, and when
  they do, you can often find yourself left with an ascetic handful of tools in
  a terminal flashing at you cheerfully. After becoming proficient with your
  system's core utilities, you should be able to diagnose your problem to some
  extent. Hell, in a "broken X11" kind of situation, you could simply fire up a
  text-based web browser (like `lynx` or `w3m`), find the solution and apply it
  right away! But the possibilities certainly don't end at X11's whims.
* **You're gonna look like a hacker** - no explanation needed,
  CLI is the :hankey:!

# Vim - **the** editor
You may have already guessed that I really, really like [vim][vim-website].  Vi
Improved (or vim for short) is a text editor created by Bram Moolenaar in 1991\.
Vim is in fact a modern take on `vi`, the ancient editor found in UNIX, written
by Bill Joy in 1976 (only 4 years after Dennis Ritchie designed C!).  Vi-style
key bindings seem to transcend all space and time, as there even exist key maps
for vi[m]'s infamous archenemy - `emacs`.

# Why use it?
Vi's renowned interface works by providing the user with several modes that
segregate different actions performed on a file - the editor gives your keys
different meanings depending on the mode you're in. This design allows for
maximizing shortcut ergonomy, preferring single keystrokes over painstaking
combinations, and keeping you in the alphanumerical block as long as possible -
pretty much what we're going for, aye?

# But how long do I need to stay in my ~~mom's~~ basement to learn this... thing?
The most straightforward way of learning vim is to fire up `vimtutor` - the
simple tutorial bundled with the editor's package. Vim has one steep learning
curve, which often becomes the subject of jokes - most notably about exiting the
editor, which doesn't work with the usual `Ctrl+C` shortcut (vimtutor tells you
about exiting vim in Lesson 1.2 :smile:). Vim **is** difficult to learn, but
your effort will pay off. Its interface is very efficient and in fact functions
like a sort of _language for text editing_, widely-used even outside
the editor, e.g.  a bunch of keystrokes like `d10w` would translate to "delete
10 words", which would do roughly what it says, deleting the next ten words
after cursor.

Enough about vim, if you're not buying into my shameless propaganda, that's
perfectly fine. There's always emacs and other great text editing solutions
to try.

# A word on terminal multiplexing
Having split-screen terminals is awesome, but do you know what's even better?
That's right, it's letting a **terminal** program do the splitting. Using a
terminal multiplexer in fact enables you to have multi-terminal sessions over a
single SSH (or serial) connection! The most prominent terminal multiplexers (in
descending order by popularity) consist of `screen`, `tmux`, and `byobu`. I'm
the most comfortable with tmux, which is found in more systems than byobu and
still has more functionality than screen.

## Don't leave the Web out! :spider: :spider_web:
One day, I was lucky to find out that one can successfully browse the web
without a mouse. The market-leading browsers offer some very nifty solutions to
achieve that. (Almost) needless to say, vi's omnipresence strikes again, as most
mouseless browser plugins base on vi-like bindings, which will certainly benefit
those who already know vim.

If you're a Firefox user, I can recommend you `VimFx` - a very well integrated
extension with a minimal, non-invasive set of features. Even if the website
you're viewing has its own keyboard shortcuts, you can always disable the plugin
completely with a single `i` keystroke or by just choosing an appropriate option
in the plugin's menu. If you forget a key in VimFx, you can always open the
cheat-sheet dialog by pressing `?` in "normal" mode.

From a web developer's standpoint, it may be worth noting that Firefox has a vim
mode in its development tools:

*Just hit* `F12` *and have some fun!*

## Pave your screen with tiling windows
Finally, the last thing which I'd like to cover - desktop environments. A great
use for your keyboard in that department is offered by the `tiling window
manager` desktop environment family. The "tiling" part simply means that every
window tries to take as much space as possible while sticking to a predefined
method of placing new windows. The most popular examples involve environments
like `i3`, `awesome`, `xmonad` or `dwm`.

Personally, I fell in love with i3, as it offered me the most approachable
defaults and an easy to grasp configuration file + it integrates with multiple
monitors easily. Also, it knows about special cases where tiling should be
turned off and supports mixed floating and tiling modes.

*i3 in action on a dual-head setup*

If you think about it, most of the tools which I've described allow for
different kinds of tiling, be it vim splits, tmux splits or i3 windows. This
makes for quite some liberty to choose the best window layout for a given task.

## Conclusion
With the above, I hope I managed to show you a fun new way to interact with your
machine. If you have anytihng to say or a question to ask, feel free to leave a
