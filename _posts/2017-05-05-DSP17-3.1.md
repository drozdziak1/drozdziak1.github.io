Did you know that vim has a built-in spellchecker? You turn it on with `:set
spell` and set the language via `set spelllang=<your_language>`.

A couple weeks ago, I fired up vim to write a post for the blog. I had the
spellchecker on, and I needed to check something in the kernel docs. I stumbled
upon a file about memory barriers, went about my business, and then [there it
was][memory-barriers]. I've found a typo! The word "architecture" was
misspelled. I decided to snoop around and maybe find some more. It turns out
that there's more typos than you think - and they're all waiting for someone to
correct them.

After correcting a couple more typos, I've made a commit and formed a patch. I
sent it to the [linux-doc][linux-doc] mailing list:
```plain
This patch corrects a couple mistakes I've found when reading through
Documentation/.

This is my first submission and I hope to send more meaningful
fixes in the future.

It turns out that I've made a couple mistakes, pointed out in response by Jon
Corbet, the docs maintainer:

It's a good start.  A couple of notes, though:

 - Please copy the docs maintainer (me) on documentation patches.
 - Please places patches inline, not as attachments.  If you've not read
   through Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst, that would be a
   good thing to do.

This file is maintained by Paul McKenney, so you'll want to make a separate
patch and copy him on it.

Care to rework along those lines?

Thanks,

jon
```

After some reworking, I split the patch as suggested and resent with correct
maintainers/developers CC'd, starting with `memory-barriers.txt` and Paul
McKenney:

```plain
So here we are, this is my first contribution. I looked through the file with
":set spell" and this seems like the only real typo. It's not much, but I've got
more coming.

After a couple hours, I've got Paul's response. It seems that my patch still
wasn't perfect, but he decided to take it in anyway:

Thank you, queued for 4.13 (or whenever Jon wants to take it).  Good
show on getting your first patch posted!

I reworked your subject line and commit log, please see below (and
please let me know if my reworking was in any way problematic).
The word following the ":" on the subject line must be capitalized,
and the subject line should describe the change rather than the bug.

The body of the commit log is almost optional for this type of fix,
but if present it should describe the bug and fix.

							Thanx, Paul

I did it! It felt really great to see Paul come back to me with the patch
accepted. I've never thought that contributing to an open-source project could
be this simple. That particular patch didn't make it to mainline yet, but
there's already three other commits that Jon had passed through to the main
kernel repo:

_Yaaay!_ :champagne: :confetti_ball:

I hope that my little adventure showed you that getting started with the
contributions really isn't difficult at all. I really encourage everyone to try
this out - even such small fixes as mine getting accepted into the codebase were
a very motivating experience. See you on a mailing list! :slightly_smiling_face:
