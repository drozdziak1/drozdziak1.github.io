Linux is capable of many interesting things, and loadable module functionality
is one of them. Linux kernel modules are just pieces of binary that can get
linked on-the-fly against a running kernel. This approach is especially nice
for speeding up your code-compile-run cycle and in systems that frown upon
downtimes. Today, we're going to harness that power and write a module that will
print two messages on module load and unload, respectively.

# Prerequisites
* **A (virtual) machine running Linux** - If you're already running Linux the VM
  is optional, as it's hard to break anything with this particular module
* **Basic understanding of C and simple GNU Makefiles** - There's finally gonna
  be C code involved; to build our module we'll use a simple makefile

# Coding style
Before we write any code it's important to mention *how* to write it. Some
of the most important guidelines involve:
* **8-space-wide tabs** - Most programmers would probably expect 4 spaces for
  indentation; with Linux we're using actual tab characters set to the width of
  8 spaces; Vim users will be happy to know that a plugin called
  [vim-sleuth][vim-sleuth-gh] can deduce the indentation from the current buffer
  and comply with it accordingly, thus eliminating the need to adjust the
  settings manually
* **80 column line width limit** - Linux is not much different here from other
  coding conventions - if leaving stuff inline significantly benefits
  readability, it's acceptable to do it
* **When in doubt, comply with K&R** - When Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis
  Ritchie wrote **"The C programming language"** (a.k.a. **K&R**), their
  creation also established a robust standard for C coding style. In fact, what
  Linux is using can be thought of as a compatible subset of those rules
* **Keep your functions short** - There's only so many things a human being can
  track simultaneously

# The code
At last, the source. Here's the module I wrote
```c
#include <linux/module.h> /* Needed by all modules */
#include <linux/kernel.h> /* For KERN_INFO */

int __init hello_init(void)
{
        printk(KERN_INFO "Hello, world!\n");

        return 0;
}

void __exit hello_exit(void)
{
        printk(KERN_INFO "Goodbye, world!\n");

        return;
}

module_init(hello_init);
module_exit(hello_exit);

MODULE_DESCRIPTION("My \"Hello, World!\" module");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Stan Drozd <drozdziak1@gmail.com>");
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");

```
*You can also find the code in the course's [repository][kernel-safari]*

Let's have a closer look on what the module does.

First, we include a header used by modules in particular - `module.h`. Then, we
want `kernel.h` for the log level macros used by `printk` for grouping log
information by level of severity/importance

`hello_init` is our module's init function - it'll make all preparations
necessary to get our module ready to do its job (in our case we only want to
greet the globe). Init functions are usually called only once on module load.
The `__init` attribute tells your kernel to free the memory `hello_init` was
occupying.

`hello_exit` on the other hand cares about everything that has to do with
cleaning up after your module when you unload it.

# The build
* Present the basic Makefile

# Compiling against the running kernel


# Compiling against a specific kernel tree

# Lodaing and unloading of kernel modules
* insmod/rmmod
* modprobe
* modinfo
* lsmod
