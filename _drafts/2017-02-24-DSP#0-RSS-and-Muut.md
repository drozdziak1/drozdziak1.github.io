When I first heard about Jekyll,  it  was  an  epiphany.   The  main  highlights
include:
* Free hosting on [GitHub][ghpages]
* Battle-tested, breeze-to-use Markdown syntax
* Approachable template system
* Efortless security through static documents

# The catch
Although the defaults work decently, the stock Minima theme leaves something  to
be desired, like RSS feeds by category and - in my case - an embeddable comment
section that would just **work**. In this first post we'll take a closer look at
the two issues.
