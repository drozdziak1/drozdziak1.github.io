# So... you wanna do some Kernel Hacking?
If your answer (to both questions, preferably) is "yes" then you're probably in
the right place. But before we do anything, we'd be better off knowing what it
is that we want to hack.

# What the hell is a kernel?
There's a couple definitions we could put up with, but most prominently, a
kernel is the centerpiece of every operating system, a program that has the
ultimate control over all the hardware and software present in a system. If we
were to bake a cake from all things that make a computer work, we'd find our
kernel in the second layer - that sour jam below all the other fluffy software
cream, yet just above its crusty bottom - the hardware, if you may.
:upside_down_face: As if OS was a country, the kernel would be it's government.

# What does it do, though?
The definition above may sound a bit vague, but that's because kernels come in
various shapes and sizes - and so do their responsibilities. A kernel supplies
everything above it with a minimal API consistent above 

The two most popular
designs are microkernels and monolithic kernels. The former aims at doing the
bare by itself, while letting other programs and services tend to less curcial
tasks, such as 

# What's the difference?
Yes, a monolithic kernel (such as Linux) controls virtually **everything**.
No thing can happen without a monolithic kernel knowing.
