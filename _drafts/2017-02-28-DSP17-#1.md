# So... you wanna do some Kernel Hacking?
If your answer (to both questions, preferably) is "yes" then you're probably in
the right place. But before we do anything, we'd be better off knowing what it
is that we want to hack.

# What the hell is a kernel?
There's a couple definitions we could put up with, but most prominently, a
kernel is the first piece of code executed by the CPU after the (optional)
bootloader stage completes. This program resides then in the memory until
shutdown and provides all services vital for an operating system to work. If
this sounds confusing to you, don't worry, we're going to cover an example boot
sequence in future posts.

# But what does it mean for a kernel to be monolithic?

Yes, a monolithic kernel (such as Linux) controls virtually
**everything** behind the scenes. There's no thing that could happen
in such an OS about which the kernel wouldn't know.
