In my [previous post]({% post_url 2017-03-02-DSP17-1-the-kernel-role-in-OS %}),
I mentioned that some errors in the kernel usually mean reboots. You can
certainly agree that whenever one learns a new technology, mistakes are
inevitable. You can imagine that rebooting after every error we cause can become
a bit time-consuming. Needless to say, crashing the live kernel on a machine
with unsaved work can be **very** disheartening and might lead to more
serious filesystem corruptions.

For that reason, we're going to build ourselves a bare bones virtual machine
using an emulator called [QEMU][qemu]. This VM will then boot the kernel and
give us a simple shell with a bunch of tools. Using a virtual machine also
stands together with easy debugging and fine-grained control over the system's
virtual hardware.

# My earlier attempts
Before starting this blog, I tried to build [something similar][picotux], but it
didn't turn out that great. Let's make things right this time, shall we?

# What you'll need
* QEMU - 
* Basic grasp on GNU Makefiles
* Fundamental git and Linux terminal know-how

# Setting up our git repo and submodules
```shell
$ git submodule add https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
$ git submodule add https://github.com/mirror/busybox.git
```

# Writing the Makefile
* Automatic build invocation

# Compiling
* menuconfig in linux and BB

# Lift-off! :rocket:
* Add QEMU invocation to the Makefile

# Known problems
* The kvm group

# Okay, what now?
* Announce the next post

  beginners
