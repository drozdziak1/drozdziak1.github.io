If you read my [previous post]({%2017-03-02-DSP17-#1-the-kernel-role-in-OS%}) Today we're going to piece together a bare bones easy testing and debugging of kernel modules.

# My earlier attempts
I tried to create something similar before, but the end result wasn't too promising. Let's make things right this
time :upside_down_face:

# What you'll need
* QEMU
* Basic grasp on GNU Makefiles
* Git skills
* Fundamental Linux know-how

# Setting up git submodules
```shell
$ git submodule add https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
$ git submodule add https://github.com/mirror/busybox.git
```

# Writing the Mekefile
* Automatic build invocation

# Compiling
* menuconfig in linux and BB

# Running
* QEMU invocation

# Known problems
* The kvm group

# Okay, what now?
*
