In my [previous post]({% post_url 2017-03-02-DSP17-1-the-kernel-role-in-OS %}),
I mentioned that some errors in the kernel usually mean reboots. You can
certainly agree that whenever one learns a new technology, mistakes are
inevitable, and rebooting after every error we cause could become a bit
time-consuming. Needless to say, crashing the live kernel on a machine with
unsaved work can be **very** disheartening - it can also lead to more serious
filesystem corruptions.

# The plan
To speed up our development process, we're going to build ourselves a bare bones
virtual machine using an emulator called [QEMU][qemu]. This VM will then boot
the kernel and give us a simple shell with a bunch of tools. Using a virtual
machine also stands together with easy debugging and fine-grained control over
the system's virtual hardware.

Before starting this blog, I tried to build [something similar][picotux], but it
didn't turn out that great. feel free to give  Let's make things right this
time, shall we?

# Prerequisites
Even though we're not writing any C code yet, some preparations for the
development environment are necessary. Here's what we're gonna use:
* **QEMU** - The hypervisor for our VM; when installing QEMU, most Linux
  distributions and [macOS][qemu-mac] should have you covered, though I don't
  recommend following this tutorial on Windows (but if you really want,
  [precompiled binaries][qemu-windows-binaries] and [Cygwin][cygwin] could be of
  help)
* **Basic grasp on GNU Make** - Makefiles are the kernel's build system of
  choice, in our case useful for automatically handling the compilation process,
  as well as creating the VM's filesystem image
* **Linux** - Duh! :upside_down_face:
* **BusyBox** - An application suite meant as a [GNU coreutils][coreutils]
  alternative; typically built as a single size-optimized binary, which uses
  specially named symlinks to act as different command-line tools like `ls`,
  `rm`, `cp`, `tar` etc.
* **Working git knowledge** - Git is the industry's leading version control
  system at the moment; in fact, git's initial purpose was to track changes in
  Linux (!) after the previously used proprietary solution was discontinued.
  With both BusyBox and the kernel using git, sticking to the same VCS seems
  like a good idea

# Enter the submodules!
For downloading Linux and BusyBox code, we'll use git's
[submodules][git-submodules]. Submodules are nothing more than nested
repositories checked out at a given commit in some other top-level repo. Let's
use an example to put that into perspective.

Suppose you had a git repository `foo`. Inside, you could define a submodule
`bar` pulled from a remote at `https://www.example.com/bar.git`, checked out at
`abcd1234` in a directory `bar_dir/`. When you do that, repository `foo` stores
information only about those 4 things - the submodule's name (`"bar"`), path
(`bar_dir/`), remote URL (`https://www.example.com/bar.git`) and the hash of
it's desired `HEAD` (`abcd1234`). That way, `foo` doesn't need to store the
whole of `bar`, while referencing a known state of its files at the same time.
When you pull the submodule, `bar_dir/` will reflect the contents of `bar` at
`abcd1234`.

# Repository setup
Let's start by creating an empty repository and pulling two submodules for Linux
and BusyBox (optionally, you could go and grab something to eat as both pulls
may take some time to complete):

> At the time of writing this post, connections to the original
> [kernel.org][linux-repo] and [busybox.net][busybox-repo] repos seem a bit
> flaky - the commands below fall back to the GitHub mirrors.

```shell
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
git submodule add https://github.com/mirror/busybox.git
git commit -m "add linux and busybox submodules"
```
*Hopefully, you should end up with two directories named `busybox` and `linux`*

# Building Linux
Linux, being a huge project, eventually developed a build configuration system
called `kbuild`. You can expect me to explain it in a future post, but this
time we'll only nudge it by selecting a default config:

```shell
cd linux/
make defconfig
```
The output should look something like this:

```plaintext
*** Default configuration is based on 'x86_64_defconfig'
#
# configuration written to .config
#
```
Now, it is time to finally compile. Let's build, already!

```shell
make -jN # N should be the number of CPU cores in your system
```

It's possible that during the compilation process you'll get error messages
about missing dependencies of the build environment - this is quite normal if
you've never built any C code on your computer, just look for your
distribution's instructions on getting the necessary packages.

When you get your build to finish without error, your output should end with a
message about the location of your warm, freshly built kernel :penguin:
:hotsprings: - something similar to this:

```plaintext
[...]
Setup is 15836 bytes (padded to 15872 bytes).
System is 6657 kB
CRC d8c5cae9
Kernel: arch/x86/boot/bzImage is ready  (#1)
```

# Lift-off! :rocket:
To execute your kernel in QEMU, run this in your terminal:

```shell
qemu-system-$(uname -m) -kernel arch/$(uname -m)/boot/bzImage -append console=ttyS0 -nographic
```

To exit the VM, press `Ctrl+a` and then `x`.

The command above might likely fail due to insufficient permissions of your
user's account. Many distributions only allow QEMU VMs to be run by members of
the `kvm` group. Check your account with the `groups` command and if `kvm` is not
there, add it with:

```shell
sudo usermod -a -G kvm <your_username>
```
After getting into the group, simply log out and come back in for the change to
take effect.

If you got QEMU correctly installed, you should notice that after a stream of kernel log
entries storms through your terminal it'll suddenly stop after a couple seconds
with...
