If you look back at my [first post]({% post_url
2017-03-02-DSP17-1-the-kernel-role-in-OS %}) in this series, you'll see that at
some point I mentioned that critical errors in the kernel usually mean reboots. 

# My earlier attempts
Before starting this blog, I tried to build [something
similar][picotux]

# What you'll need
* QEMU
* Basic grasp on GNU Makefiles
* Fundamental Linux command-line and git know-how

# Setting up git submodules
```shell
$ git submodule add https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
$ git submodule add https://github.com/mirror/busybox.git
```

# Writing the Mekefile
* Automatic build invocation

# Compiling
* menuconfig in linux and BB

# Running
* QEMU invocation

# Known problems
* The kvm group

# Okay, what now?
* 

# Lift-off! :rocket:
