In my [previous post]({% post_url 2017-03-02-DSP17-1-the-kernel-role-in-OS %}),
I mentioned that critical errors in the kernel usually mean reboots. While
learning the basics of kernel development, we're going to cause a ton of them.

# My earlier attempts
Before starting this blog, I tried to build [something
similar][picotux], but it didn't turn out that great. Let's make things right
this time, shall we?

# What you'll need
* QEMU
* Basic grasp on GNU Makefiles
* Fundamental Linux command-line and git know-how

# Setting up git repo and submodules
```shell
$ git submodule add https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
$ git submodule add https://github.com/mirror/busybox.git
```

# Writing the Makefile
* Automatic build invocation

# Compiling
* menuconfig in linux and BB

# Lift-off! :rocket:
* Add QEMU invocation to the Makefile

# Known problems
* The kvm group

# Okay, what now?
* Preview the next post
