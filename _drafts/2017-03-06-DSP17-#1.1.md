Are you a touch typist? You probably are, and I am one too. Do you like moving
your hand away to reach for the mouse in order to do that one little
shit-of-a-thing that can't be dealt with using a shortcut? Of course you do...
**not!**

This time, I'd like to share some insight on ways to eradicate the wretched
rodent from your workflow and minimize the distraction involved. Because of the
scope of this series, the solutions I'm about to present are meant mainly for
the Linux user, being mostly compatible with macOS and other \*nix flavors.
Let's zoom in on the things that could help you better cherish the safety of
your home row.

# Before we abandon the mouse completely
Pointing devices **do** bring some strong arguments to the table. They assume an
undeniable position in tasks like digital art or CAD. Things like going through
an application for the first time can also turn out easier with a mouse, i.e.
you don't wonder which shortcut does what, you just find the option in a menu +
often learn the shortcut anyway at the same time.

# Stop worrying and love the terminal :nerd_face:
I've gotta admit, the terminal grew in my toolbox to become the keystone of my
process as a programmer. Before we advanced into graphical user interfaces,
there was next to no other option than to rely on the keyboard alone. Mice would
only save you a couple keystrokes when moving around in your editor (which,
confronted with a text UI masterpiece like vim wouldn't necessarily mean an
improvement). Even today almost every text application is easy on the mouse, if
supporting it at all. For that reason alone, it may be worth your while to give
_the ancient way_ a shot, but the benefits don't end there:

* **Consistence across distributions** - thanks to common UNIX specifications
  like [POSIX][posix], many \*nix OSes share the well known command-line
  utilities like `sed`, `grep`, `tar` or `vi`, regardless of the distro in
  question using X11, Wayland, GTK, Qt, being Linux, BSD, macOS or whatever.
* **Almost everything you do in a terminal is scriptable** - shells,
  pipes, exit codes, stdin/stdout redirections. These make for very powerful
  building blocks to scripts that can repeat almost anything you do in your
  everyday terminal sessions.
* **Decent performance on potato-grade machines** - It's not much of a surprise
  that rendering elements from a finite set of predefined font characters is
  orders of magnitude cheaper than displaying sophisticated GUIs on the user's
  screen, and supporting the underlying desktop environment. The dumbest of
  chips know how to speak over a serial console or using SSH. Having a favorite
  bunch of text-based tools, we can do great things on machines of not-so-great
  performance.
* **Where there is a shell, there is a way!** - Things break, and when they do,
  you are often left with an ascetic handful of tools and a modest shell. Armed
  with the core utilities, you should be able to diagnose your problem to
  some extent. Hell, in a "broken X11" kind of situation, you could simply fire
  up a text-based web browser (like `lynx` or `w3m`) and find and apply the
  solution right away!
* **You're gonna look like a hacker** - There, I've finally said it.  CLI is the
  :hankey:!

# Vim - **the** editor
You have probably guessed that I really, really like [vim][vim-website]. Vi
Improved (or vim for short) is a text editor created by Bram Moolenaar in 1991.
Vim is in fact a modern take on `vi`, the ancient text editor found in UNIX,
written by Bill Joy in 1976 (only 4 years after Dennis Ritchie designed C!).

Vim works by providing the user with several modes that let them do different
things - consequently, the editor gives your keys different meanings depending
on the mode you're in. This design allows for maximizing shortcut ergonomy,
favoring single keystrokes over painstaking combinations, and keeping you in the
alphanumerical block as much as possible - pretty much what we're going for,
huh?

It's this modality that has made vim so popular among programmers - people who
should know pretty well about the perils of sore palms and keystroke wastefulness.


# A word on terminal emulators
* Pick a terminal program that has the least invasive shortcuts

# Don't leave the Web out!
To me, VimFx is *the* plugin for mouseless web page navigation. If you'd like a
deeper modification of your browser's behavior, you can also always go with
Vimperator

# Pave your screen with tiling windows
