Are you a touch typist? You probably are, and I am one too. Do you like moving
your hand away to reach for the mouse in order to do that one little
shit-of-a-thing that can't be dealt with using a shortcut? Of course you do...
**not!**

This time, I'd like to share some insight on ways to eradicate the wretched
rodent from your workflow and minimize the distraction involved. Because of the
scope of this series, the solutions I'm about to present are meant mainly for
the Linux user, being mostly compatible with macOS and other \*nix flavors.
Let's zoom in on the things that could help you better cherish the safety of
your home row.

# Before we abandon the mouse completely
Pointing devices **do** bring some strong arguments to the table. They assume an
undeniable position in tasks like digital art or CAD. Things like going through
an application for the first time can also turn out easier with a mouse, i.e.
you don't wonder which shortcut does what, you just find the option in a menu +
often learn the shortcut anyway at the same time.

# Stop worrying and love the terminal :nerd_face:
Before we advanced into graphical user interfaces, there was next to no other
option than to rely on the keyboard alone. Mice would only save you a couple
keystrokes when moving around in your editor (which, confronted with a text UI
masterpiece like vim wouldn't necessarily mean an improvement). Even
today almost every text application is easy on the mouse, if supporting it at
all. For that reason alone, it may be worth your while to give _the ancient way_
a shot, but the benefits don't end there:

* **Consistence across distributions** - Thanks to common UNIX-like system
  specifications like [POSIX][posix], many \*nix OSes share the well known
  command line tools.
* **Almost everything you do in a terminal is scriptable**
* **Decent performance on potato-grade machines** - 
* **Where there is a shell, there is a way!** - Things break, and when they do,
  you are often left with an ascetic handful of tools and a shell.

I've gotta admit, the terminal grew in my toolbox to become the keystone of my
process as a programmer.

# Vim - **the** editor


# A word on terminal emulators
* Pick a terminal program that has the least invasive shortcuts

# Don't leave the Web out!
To me, VimFx is *the* plugin for mouseless web page navigation. If you'd like a
deeper modification of your browser's behavior, you can also always go with
Vimperator

# Pave your screen with tiling windows
