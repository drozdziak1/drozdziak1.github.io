In my [previous post]({% post_url 2017-03-02-DSP17-1-the-kernel-role-in-OS %}),
I mentioned that some errors in the kernel usually mean reboots. You can
certainly agree that whenever one learns a new technology, mistakes are
inevitable, and rebooting after every error we cause could become a bit
time-consuming. Needless to say, crashing the live kernel on a machine with
unsaved work can not only be **very** disheartening, but also it can lead to
more serious filesystem corruptions.

# The plan
To speed up our development process, we're going to build ourselves a bare bones
virtual machine using an emulator called [QEMU][qemu]. This VM will then boot
the kernel and give us a simple shell with a bunch of tools. Using a virtual
machine also stands together with easy debugging and fine-grained control over
the system's virtual hardware.

Before starting this blog, I tried to build [something similar][picotux], but it
didn't turn out that great. Let's make things right this time, shall we?

# Prerequisites
Even though we're not writing any C code yet, some preparations for the
development environment are necessary. Here's what we're gonna use:
* **Linux** - Duh!
* **BusyBox** - An application suite meant as a [GNU coreutils][coreutils]
  alternative; typically built as a single size-optimized binary, which uses
  specially named symlinks to act as different command-line tools like `ls`,
  `rm`, `cp`, `tar` etc.
* **QEMU** - The hypervisor for our VM; when installing QEMU, most Linux
  distributions and [macOS][qemu-mac] should have you covered, though I don't
  recommend following this tutorial on Windows (but if you really want,
  [precompiled binaries][qemu-windows-binaries] and [Cygwin][cygwin] could be of
  help)
* **Basic grasp on GNU Make** - The classic Makefiles still remain the
  kernel's build system of choice, a little manual compilation-fu won't hurt
  either.
* **Working git knowledge** - Git is the industry's leading version control
  system at the moment; in fact, git's initial purpose was to track changes in
  Linux(!) after the previously used proprietary solution was discontinued. With
  both Linux and BusyBox using git, sticking to the same VCS seems like a good
  idea

# Enter the submodules!
For downloading Linux and BusyBox code, we'll use git's
[submodules][git-submodules]. Submodules are nothing more than nested
repositories checked out at a given commit in some other top-level repo. Let's
put that into perspective:

Suppose you had a git repository `foo`. Inside, you could define a submodule
`bar` pulled from a remote at `https://www.example.com/bar.git`, checked out at
`abcd1234` in a directory `bar_dir/`. When you do that, repository `foo` stores
information only about those 4 things - the submodule's name (`"bar"`), relative
path (`bar_dir/`), remote URL (`https://www.example.com/bar.git`) and the hash
of it's desired revision (`abcd1234`). That way, `foo` doesn't need to store the
whole of `bar`, while referencing a known state of its files at the same time.
When you pull the submodule, `bar_dir/` will reflect the contents of `bar` at
`abcd1234`.

# Repository setup
Let's start by creating an empty repository and pulling two submodules for Linux
and BusyBox (optionally, you could go and grab something to eat as both pulls
may take some time to complete):

> At the time of writing this post, connections to the original

> flaky - the commands below fall back to the GitHub mirrors.

```shell
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
git submodule add https://github.com/mirror/busybox.git
git commit -m "add linux and busybox submodules"
```
*Hopefully, you should end up with two directories named* `busybox` *and*
`linux`

# Building Linux
Linux, being a huge project, eventually developed a build configuration system
called `kbuild`. You can expect me to explain it in a future post, but this
time we'll only nudge it by selecting a default config:

```shell
cd linux/
make defconfig
```
The output should look something like this:

```plaintext
*** Default configuration is based on 'x86_64_defconfig'
#
# configuration written to .config
#
```
Now, it is time to finally compile. Let's build, already!

```shell
make -jN # N should be the number of CPU cores in your system
```
A correct build's output should end with a message about the location of your
warm, freshly built kernel - something similar to this:

```plaintext
[...]
Setup is 15836 bytes (padded to 15872 bytes).
System is 6657 kB
CRC d8c5cae9
Kernel: arch/x86/boot/bzImage is ready  (#1)
```

If you're not sure, check the `$?` variable, which stores the return value of
your last command (should be `0` on normal exit):

```shell
echo $?
```

# Lift-off! (?)
To execute your kernel in QEMU, run this in your terminal:

```shell
qemu-system-$(uname -m) -kernel arch/$(uname -m)/boot/bzImage -append console=ttyS0 -nographic
```
*The* `$(uname -m)` *parts resolve to your architecture's name; to exit the
VM, press* `Ctrl+a` *and then* `x`

If you got QEMU correctly installed, you should see a bunch of log entries storm
through your terminal. It should then stop after a couple seconds with...

```plaintext

...a kernel panic.

# "Uh-oh!" a.k.a. Kernel prose rendition
Let's peek into the log excerpt from above, figure out what it means and why
we crashed. Have a look at the first couple of lines:

```plaintext
[    4.000081] VFS: Cannot open root device "(null)" or unknown-block(0,0): error -6
[    4.003700] Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partitions:
[    4.005934] 0b00         1048575 sr0
```

In the leftmost column we can see the time since the kernel's start in a
`<seconds>.<microseconds>` format. Then, we've got a message suggesting that an
entity called `VFS` (Virtual File System, a filesystem abstraction used in
Linux) has problems with accessing some device. Looks like we forgot to define
something, as the next line follows up by requesting us to set a `root` boot
argument.

It turns out that the kernel behaved exactly as it should - we didn't name any
device to mount as `/`, so Linux just shrugs and crashes, as it doesn't even
know where to look for an `init` program.

To fix that, we're going to create a [ramdisk][ramdisk-wiki], which QEMU will
then load to act as a filesystem image for our kernel. There, we will form a
simple environment that will let us access a shell with some command-line tools.
Let's start by building BusyBox.

# Getting your box busy (Ha, ha.)
Let's head over to the BusyBox directory and create the
default configuration:

```shell
cd ../busybox
make defconfig
```
*Looks familiar, huh? BusyBox is using kbuild too!*

This time, we're gonna change one option in our config before starting the
build. It turns out that the default build links BusyBox **dynamically** against
your host system's shared libraries. Since our virtual machine isn't gonna
provide BusyBox with any of its dependencies, we'll need to link it
**statically** - that is, to embed the necessary libraries directly in the
program's binary. To do that, start a configuration editing script:

```shell
make menuconfig # or gconfig, xconfig
```
`menuconfig` *is one of many frontends available for editing Linux-like configs.
It's the most popular, so that's what I recommend to use.*

After the configuration window appears, select `Busybox Settings` and hit enter.
Then, use your arrows to go down and select `Build BusyBox as a static
binary (no shared libs)` (hit `space` and an asterisk should show to the left).
Exit, choose to save your changes and build!

```shell
make -jN # Again, N is your system's CPU core count
```

To make sure that the resulting executable is statically linked, let's see what
`ldd` has to say about it:

```shell
ldd ./busybox
```
`ldd` *is a tool for viewing shared library dependencies in a program*

If you got the config right, ldd should fend you off with a `not a dynaimc
executable` message. Looks like we're almost there! Let's go and see about that
filesystem image.

# Creating an initramfs image
`initramfs` stands for `init`ial `RAM` `f`ile`s`ystem. It's basically a
small filesystem that resides in RAM and provides your kernel with the tools
it needs to proceed with bringing up the rest of your OS.

Linux sources offer many useful tools, and `usr/gen_init_cpio` is one of them.
`gen_init_cpio` is a program for generating filesystem images exactly like the
one we're after. One way to use it is to have it run during the Linux build and
append the resulting initramfs image to your kernel. Alternatively, you can keep
the images separate, and that's what we're going to do for now.

Let's start by creating a `initramfs_desc` file which will describe the files we
want in our image and where to put them:

```plaintext
# type          dest            src             perm    usr     grp

# dirs
dir             /bin                            775     0       0
dir             /proc                           775     0       0
dir             /sys                            775     0       0
dir             /dev/pts                        775     0       0

# files
file            /init           init.sh         775     0       0
file            /bin/busybox    busybox/busybox 775     0       0

# symlinks
slink           /bin/sh         /bin/busybox    775     0       0

# devnodes
nod             /dev/zero                       666     0       0       c 1 5
nod             /dev/null                       666     0       0       c 1 3
nod             /dev/console                    666     0       0       c 5 1
```

## Known problems

# QEMU complains about permissions
QEMU commands shown above might likely fail due to insufficient permissions of
your user's account. Many distributions only allow QEMU VMs to be run by members
of the `kvm` group. Check your account with the `groups` command and if `kvm` is
not there, add it with `usermod`:

```shell
sudo usermod -a -G kvm <your_username>
```
After getting into the group, simply log out and come back in for the change to
take effect.

# `<some_package>` is not installed
It's possible that during the compilation process you'll get error messages
about missing dependencies of the build environment - this is quite normal if
you've never built any C code on your computer, just look for your
distribution's instructions on getting the necessary packages.
