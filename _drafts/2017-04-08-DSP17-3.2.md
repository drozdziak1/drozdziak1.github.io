Complaining is cheap, while criticism is hard - both to take and give.

* This can be easily applied to any other field than programming
* Try not to get emotional, or it may diminish everything that was professional
  about your opinion
* If the stakes are high, use the author's imagination, not heavy insults to
  show them the risks
* Appreciate the parts you like
* Remember that what you have to say can and **will** only represent what
  you *think* is right
* Examples of bad criticism turning into great feedback
* Never ever look down on the author when you find their mistake

* Tell them that soft skills look interesting and a piece about motivation would
  be nice in the future
* Encourage readers to comment and joke (?) about using the point of view I
  shared
